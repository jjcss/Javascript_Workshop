# Javascript_Workshop
<p> November 11, 2021 <br>
Javascript Workshop for the Computer Science Society Club </p>

In this workshop, the CSS club decided to do a code along HTML/CSS workshop by creating a simple/introductory website to a place that you would like to visit. 
We used repl.it for the code-along, but in this workshop we managed to go over basic topics like what tags are, different type of tags, formatting your HTML file in a separate CSS, accessing images in folders...etc. We hope you all enjoyed this workshop and if you have any questions feel free to message any of the Executives on Discord or feel free to email us.

We hope you walk away with some knowledge and that you got to have some fun while doing it!
